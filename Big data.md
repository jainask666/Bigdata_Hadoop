* what is Big Data ?

** Ans:  
       
       big data gets generated in multi terabyte quantities. It changes fast and comes in varieties of forms that are difficult to 
        manage and process using RDBMS or other traditional technologies. Big Data solutions provide the tools, methodologies, and technologies 
        that are used to capture, store, search & analyze the data in seconds to find relationships and insights for innovation and competitive 
        gain that were previously unavailable.
        80% of the data getting generated today is unstructured and cannot be handled by our traditional technologies. 
        Earlier, an amount of data generated was not that high. We kept archiving the data as there was just need of historical analysis of data. 
        But today data generation is in petabytes that it is not possible to archive the data again and again and retrieve it again when needed 
        as data scientists need to play with data now and then for predictive analysis unlike historical as used to be done with traditional.
        It is saying that- “An image is a worth of thousand words“. Hence we have also provided a video tutorial for more understand what is Big data and its need.
